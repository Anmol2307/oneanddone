==========

The "One and Done" initiative, previously known as "QA Taskboard", is a workflow
where Mozilla community contributors can pick tasks and work on them - one at a
time, one day at a time - and feel good about doing them.

One and Done is written with [Playdoh][playdoh] and [Django][django].

If you're interested in helping us out, please read through
