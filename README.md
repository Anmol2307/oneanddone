==========

The "One and Done" initiative, previously known as "QA Taskboard", is a workflow where Mozilla community contributors can pick tasks and work on them - one at a time, one day at a time - and feel good about doing them.
Over the last one year, Mozilla QA has held several brainstorming sessions with community contributors as to what such a Taskboard should look like.
